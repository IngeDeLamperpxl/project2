If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success. -James Cameron

First Witch:
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
Second Witch:
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
Third Witch:
Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.
First Witch:
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
ALL:
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
- MacBeth, Act IV scene 1 -
